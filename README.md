# Data integration for structure-based drug repositioning

Collection of codes for structural data formatting and integration for machine learning

ECFP_X: generation of circular fingerprint from a set of ligands and creation of the sparse matrix which will be the X for the matrix factorization tool.

IC50_Y: generation of the drug-target affinity matrix from ChEMBL data.

Logistic_ regression_PLIP_IC50: Checking the correlation between interaction profile fingerprints and biological activity data.

Sparseflow_ ECFP_IC50: Application of Macau on sparse matrices ECFP and IC50.

PLIP_sparse: generation of the sprase matrix of drug-target interaction fingerprint based on PLIP data
